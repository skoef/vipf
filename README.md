#vipf
Utility to safely edit your PF firewall on FreeBSD remotely. In case you get locked out and aren't able to confirm the proper working of the firewall, the old rules will be applied after a timeout.

vipf is an adaptation to the failsafe ipfw editing script written by Alexandre Peixoto and originally shipped with FreeBSD as `/usr/share/examples/ipfw/change_rules.sh`
